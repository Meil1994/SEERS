                <br>
                <p>(SEERS PMGI) is a home-grown brokerage and 
                   property management company based in Cagayan de Oro City, 
                   Philippines, engaged in brokerage services, processing of 
                   real estate documents, subdivision and condominium 
                   selling, real property management, and other services 
                   including property appraisal and auctions.</p>

        <section class="main_content">
            <p>It was established in 2014 by a group of young, driven, and dynamic licensed real estate brokers and 
                entrepreneurs who were inspired by the flourishing real estate industry in Northern Mindanao and the 
                entire country.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of SEERS 
                Property Management Group Inc. on April 14, 2014, with the primary purpose of engaging in integrated 
                property management programs, projects, and services; pursuing property management ventures with other 
                strategic partners and stakeholders and explore other opportunities for innovative engagements with 
                other entities and individuals for the expansion of the corporation’s network and services.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>While initially envisioned as a traditional property management firm, the new normal has presented opportunities 
                for SEERS to expand on.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2022, SEERS amended its corporate purpose with the Securities and Exchange Commission and expanded its reach as 
                an outsourced service company specializing in Credit Investigation Services, Collection, and Receivable Management 
                as well as ventures on Document Processing and Registrations for real estate loans, chattels, encumbrances, 
                and other related services. This expansion is guided by one of the incorporators (Atty Beda Joy B. Elot, CPA, REB, MM) 
                experience as a loan’s processor and banker for Eight (8) years before she joined the government in 2001. 
                Aside from this, SEERS had through the years been able to establish firm and reliable contacts in the relevant 
                government entities, such as the Register of Deeds, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the Land Transportation Office, 
                among others, a considerable competitive advantage for the corporation.
